# ccg-generator
Random card generator with cards from the Catholic Card Game.

# Background
The Catholic Card Game is in short, the Catholic version of Cards Against Humanity. The same rules and styles apply, except the cards are more catered towards those of the Catholic faith.

# How It Works
First, the player would click the first box to generate what would be the yellow color cards on the physical version of the game (the ones that have blanks on them). After that, they would click the box underneath to generate a white card (the answer card)

# Future Versions
1. Let users generate more than one card at a time
2. Integration with other similar games
